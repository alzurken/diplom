      <text text="A myth-busting analysis of population growth is refreshingly free of doomsday rhetoricGenealogy and population fascinate us all. Who are we? Where do we come from? And crucially nowadays, how many more of us can we accommodate? Can we survive the impending crisis and, if so, how?Danny Dorling, one of the UK's leading experts, tells us not to worry. His latest of several books on population takes to task the United Nations and its recent predictions of a world that will explode to 10 billion people.First some stats – and in subjects such as this, data is illuminating and vital to the task. By Dorling's reckoning, it took 64,000 years for the planet to reach its first billion, in 1820. At various points during that long period the population fell, such as during the Black Death, and other assorted plagues and pestilence, and invasions from the Mongols and others.The second billion came 106 years later, in 1926 – a speed that was 600 times faster. The third billion was recorded in 1960, only 34 years later, with the fourth in 1975. In 1988 the number rose to 5 billion – what was assumed to be the halfway point in the eventual maximum size of the species.The rate continued to increase, with 6 billion coming in 2000. Up and up and faster and faster. If growth continues at the premillennial rate of acceleration, by 2300 the world will be inhabited by 133,592 billion people. Or rather it won't. By that reckoning, we'll all have been consumed in some cauldron.There is a more serious academic debate, around a narrower band of numbers. Before May 2011 demographics boffins had broadly agreed that the world population would peak at 9.1 billion in 2100, and then fall to 8.5 billion people by 2150. Yet the UN, perhaps spooked by the 7 billion number reached in 2011, revised up its predictions, suggesting that 9.1 billion would be achieved much earlier, maybe by 2050 or before. By 2100 there would be 10.1 billion souls squashed perilously up against one another on the planet.This 10 billion mark is proving talismanic, with a spate of doom-laden books presaging the moment. One eagerly awaited tome, by Stephen Emmott, will be published shortly, with a message to be very scared. Dorling, by contrast, is more sanguine. Several factors, he argues, are driving down fertility rates. One is education. Another is public health. More intriguing is his contention about migration: &quot;People tend to rapidly adopt the fertility rates of the places they move to. If Europeans want to be well cared for in our old age, and we also want fewer future people in the world, the last thing we should be doing is trying to reduce migrationtoEurope.&quot;At every stage of the past century or two, population figures have stoked fear. The issue was central to Marxist immiseration theory in the early 19th century– the idea that the more people are born, the more capitalists will see the need to drive down wages and conditions in order to maintain their profitability.In the 20s and 30s, as arguments over genetic superiority held sway among the ruling classes, fears of population growth influenced eugenicists. One was Aldous Huxley's older brother, Julian, who as vice president of the British Eugenics Society wrote in 1926: &quot;Unless [civilised societies] invent and enforce adequate measures for regulating human reproduction, for controlling the quantity of population, and at least preventing the deterioration of quality of the radical stock, they are doomed to decay.&quot; From the 1960s and 80s dystopian books and films, from Blade Runner to Mad Max, focused either on the threat of nuclear armageddon or urban chaos, or both.Dorling punctures many myths, including the relationship between crime and population size. He provides interesting insights into the effect of population on social mobility, the wealth gap and global warming. He notes that during economic downturns, not only does fertility tend to fall (unremarkably), but also that the age difference between married partners widens.His analysis of the past convinces me more than his insights on the future. The author suggests that the world may have gone past its peak in energy consumption. That might be the case in the declining west, but surely not for Asia's booming economies.In the end he may be right: the rate of global population growth may not be as dramatic as was once feared. Inequality may be stubbornly large, and rising, within countries, but between countries and continents it is falling, posing new opportunities and insecurities.Dorling holds out the hope that a more sustainable world will be more open. Instead of pulling up the drawbridge to migrants, we should, he argues, embrace a world of unrestricted flows. I share his internationalist vision, but it remains utopian. One of the lessons of the past 20 years is that the more global we become, technologically and economically, the more perfectly decent people cleave towards the familiar.SocietyPopulationGlobalisationPovertyClimate changeEconomicsJohn Kampfnerguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="The incoming Bank of England governor has a fine track record, but to what extent has it been burnished by the demand for Canada's natural resources?Bob Robinson, the good-natured, broad-shouldered boss of Calgary construction firm Westcor, says: &quot;If you can't get a job in this city, you're not trying.&quot;Calgary is the Houston of Canada: a fast-growing city with a frontier atmosphere. The skyline is punctuated by glass and steel skyscrapers in which oil and gas executives plan multibillion-dollar investments against the distant backdrop of the snow-capped Rocky Mountains, while the eight-lane highways outside are clogged with oversized pick-up trucks.The oil and gas fields are many miles to the north, around Fort McMurray, but much of the money is made and spent here. The carefree boom times in the runup to 2007 were swept away by the financial crisis; but the continued thirst of emerging economies such as China for natural resources has helped to prop up world prices and new technology has opened up previously unreachable reserves in tar sands –highly controversial among environmental campaigners.So while much of the rest of the world remains mired in economic slump, in Calgary business is looking up.&quot;We are seeing good, steady growth, and that's the way we like it,&quot; says Robinson. With the tough-minded independence that is the stereotypical characteristic of the western Canadian, he adds that he welcomed the slowdown, because too much of a &quot;sense of entitlement,&quot; had built up before 2007. While some of his rivals did go out of business, Westcor survived and today he's ramping up investment and fretting about skills shortages (the firm recently brought in a New Zealander under Canada's temporary worker programme).Ann-Marie Lurie, a local housing market economist with the Calgary Real Estate Board, says the picture in property is similar: &quot;We're not in a boom scenario,&quot; she says. Gone are the frenzied times before 2007 when investors were snapping up homes online without even seeing them. But prices have risen by 7% in the past year, and the cost of a detached family home here has just regained its pre-crisis peak of around $400,000 (?250,000).In the pleasant, leafy neighbourhoods of Bridgeland and Kensington, quaint clapboard bungalows are being torn down to be replaced by grander, two-storey suburban homes – with built-in garages so residents don't have to step outside to get into their cars when it's -30C in the winter.&quot;We did feel the recession, no doubt about it, but we came through it relatively unscathed,&quot; says Bruce Graham, director of Calgary Economic Development.It is economic resilience like this that has helped Canada to ride out the global storm of the past five years far more successfully than most of its rivals, and burnished the reputation of Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney – soon to take up his new job at the Bank of England in London – as a monetary policy whizz. Carney was brought up in Edmonton, 180 miles north of Calgary, and equally dependent on the oil industry.&quot;Among the G7, Canada is unique,&quot; Carney argued in his valedictory speech in Montreal, modestly titled &quot;Canada Works&quot;. Carney went on: &quot;For us, the global financial crisis was an external rather than internal shock. When Canadian policymakers responded quickly and forcefully, our financial system channelled credit to where it was needed and our economy adjusted smartly.&quot;In Canada, economic output had recovered to its pre-crisis level by early 2011; in the UK, GDP remains almost 3% below its pre-recession peak.But even Carney's most ardent fans – and he has many in Canada – concede that he can't claim full credit for the country's strong performance. The benefit of natural resources, visible on every corner in Calgary, is perhaps the most important of three crucial factors that have helped to insulate the economy from the global storm.A tight hold on the purse strings was the second. While the UK entered the &quot;Great Recession&quot; running a deficit, Canada had had more than a decade of surpluses – the legacy of lessons learned during a deep fiscal crisis in the mid-1990s.At that time, the government was seen as being unable to get a grip on its spending and financial markets began to lose confidence in the Canadian dollar – comparing the country to Mexico, which had suffered a run on the peso, partly as a result of the perceived weakness of its financial management. US commentators had begun referring to Canada as a banana republic.The Liberal governments of the time, under prime minister John Chr?tien and his finance minister Paul Martin, introduced a series of tough budgets and dragged Canada back into the black, helped by rapid growth in the country's major export market, the US, and a gradual decline in interest rates across most of the major economies.Canada's third advantage was its conservative, relatively tightly regulated banking sector. When the boom was in full swing, politicians came under pressure to follow the global trend of deregulating the banks. But unlike New Labour in the UK, the Liberals refused to succumb to the allure of unleashing a swashbuckling finance sector. Instead, Canadian banks faced higher capital requirements than those included in the international Basel agreements and the government retained the power to vary criteria such as loan-to-value ratios on mortgages.After Stephen Harper's Conservative government took power in 2006, they did loosen lending requirements, allowing homebuyers to borrow over as much as 40 years with no deposit. But the rule change happened only in 2006, and the lending boom that followed was on nowhere near the scale of the sub-prime frenzy in the US.Ed Clark, chief executive of Canada's second-largest bank, TD, says as well as a different regulatory climate, there is an important difference of culture. &quot;The bank CEOs saw themselves as custodians of historical institutions,&quot; he says. &quot;I think of my job as one of passing on the institution to my successor in better shape than I got it.&quot;Asked why Canada's bank bosses never harboured Fred Goodwin-style aspirations to take on the world, Clark laughs: &quot;I think maybe because we never took ourselves that seriously: that's definitely a core Canadian characteristic. If you're sitting in London with a 150-year-old bank, you think you're the centre of the universe. We think of ourselves as a small country.&quot;Other observers say the relatively cosy nature of the Canadian banks, protected from the full blast of foreign competition by tight regulation, has also helped. John Crow, the British-born governor of the Bank of Canada from 1987 to 1994, says: &quot;Our banks have built up valuable domestic franchises. And the economics of franchises are such that they encourage you to be somewhat conservative in taking on risk. Whatever you think of that as regards competition, it adds a measure of stability to the financial system.&quot;During the credit crunch, the banks were supported by the Bank of Canada with extra liquidity – in effect, cut-price loans – but none was fragile enough to be taken over by the taxpayer.As Carney leaves for London, however, there is a niggling feeling among some in Canada that cracks are starting to appear in the country's outwardly successful economic model.A debate is raging about whether the country's reserves of black gold – and even its reputation as a &quot;safe haven&quot; amid the chaos of global markets – could become a curse, instead of a blessing.Since hitting a low of 62 cents against the US dollar in 2002, the Canadian dollar – the loonie, as it is known – has appreciated steadily. It hit parity with the dollar in 2007, and has hovered there ever since. There are growing fears that this may be evidence of a phenomenon economists call &quot;Dutch disease&quot; – where abundant natural resources drive up a country's exchange rate so far that other industries are crowded out.It's political anathema here, especially out west, to argue that oil and gas reserves are anything but a boon – or that the strength of the loonie is a problem.&quot;I look at it as, 'what are we producing best?'&quot; says Lurie with a shrug. &quot;To me, it's very clear that our economic advantage is in resources. If manufacturing's not doing well, maybe we shouldn't be doing it.&quot;Greg Stringham, of the Canadian Association of Petrol Producers, is keen to stress that reserves are widely spread across the country – with oil extraction taking place offshore in Quebec, to the east, and in British Columbia, to the west, as well as in Alberta. He points out that the complex technology required to extract oil from tar sands, or shale gas deposits from deep in the rocks, requires an array of parts – &quot;tanks, modules pumps … &quot; that are manufactured far and wide. &quot;That has really helped people to understand a bit more how important this was to the economy.&quot;&quot;Canadian industry has adjusted quite well to our currency,&quot; says Martin, the former finance minister. &quot;Of course, many people say it's because we're a commodity producer. I think the other reason for the strength of our currency is the strength of our balance sheet. We dealt with that in the mid-1990s and we're still reaping the benefits of that.&quot;Whatever the cause, there is little doubt that Canadian manufacturing was suffering, even before the downturn. &quot;The economy's become really unbalanced,&quot; says Bruce Campbell, of thinktank the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives. (CCPA) &quot;We have seen this precipitous decline in manufacturing output in relation to the rest of the economy. What the lasting damage is, we don't know.&quot;Almost 300,000 manufacturing jobs were lost between 2000 and 2011; although when Carney touched on the issue in a speech in Windsor, Ontario, in Canada's manufacturing heartland, he pointed out that a decline in industrial jobs has taken place across many industrialised economies over the past decade. &quot;Workers need to build skills and be prepared to shift jobs and even careers, if necessary,&quot; he warned. Unemployment in Ontario is 7.3%, against 4.8% in Alberta.The oil glut poses serious social questions, too. Like the financial services boom in the UK in the early noughties, Canada's resource extraction flatters the GDP figures, but despite what Bob Robinson of Westcor says, the benefits are not shared widely, even in the heart of oil country.Calgary is by far the country's most unequal city, and is becoming more so. It has its swish restaurants and casinos – but also food banks and homeless shelters. Recent research by the CCPA showed that the top 1% of Calgarians, as they are known, have seen on average a $570,000 increase in pay since 1982, adjusted for inflation; while the bottom 90% saw an increase of just $2,000.In a characteristically loose interpretation of his remit, Carney recently highlighted widening income inequality, underlining the fact that the share of income taken home by the top 1% of earners in Canada was the third-highest in the OECD – after the US and UK. His wife, Diana, who works for a centrist thinktank, Canada 2020, recently gave testimony on the issue in the Canadian parliament. &quot;One of the things about Carney which I think bodes well is that he has displayed a sensitivity to this issue,&quot; says Campbell.Perhaps the clearest sign of potential stress in the Canadian economy, and another issue repeatedly highlighted by Carney, however, is sky-high household debt: a side effect of what the International Monetary Fund has called an &quot;exuberant&quot; housing market.It is hard to walk down a street in Toronto without seeing vast signs advertising the scores of new &quot;condo&quot; developments in the city; while in Vancouver, the cosmopolitan melting pot in Canada's far west and its frothiest housing market, headlines last week highlighted the fact that a penthouse in a swanky new development had changed hands for a record $25m — a classic bubble tale.In its most recent report on the Canadian economy, the IMF suggested that average homes are on average 10% to 15% overvalued. As house prices have risen and interest rates have been slashed to help the economy through the slump, many homeowners have responded by borrowing more. Household debt now stands at 162% of GDP, which is similar to levels in the US and UK before the downturn.The finance ministry, with advice from Carney, has taken steps to slow the pace of credit growth; crucially, by tightening mortgage lending requirements. Growth rates of borrowing have come down but, at best, the heavy burden of debt is likely to be a drag on consumer spending for some time to come. At worst, it could leave Canadian households exposed if there is a sharp rise in interest rates, or a jump in unemployment.&quot;It's a gauge of vulnerability,&quot; says Craig Wright, chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada. &quot;It's not just a housing bubble potentially, but it's a personal debt bubble, which is quite closely related.&quot;He believes high debt levels and the effervescent housing market are a bigger threat to Canada than the international environment. &quot;The big risks in the past were external, which we don't really have any control over. It seems now that the domestic risks are more disconcerting.&quot; Clark, of TD Bank, agrees: &quot;I have been arguing for some time that the tailwinds that made us outperform the world for a certain period of time have gradually dissipated, and the headwinds have increased.&quot;In Calgary, the phlegmatic locals say they're always prepared for the worst. &quot;Calgary rides with what happens in energy,&quot; says Lurie. &quot;We do tend to go through booms and busts in Calgary, more so than in other areas.&quot; Meanwhile, Westcor's finance director David Vandegriff recalls a favourite Albertan bumper sticker during the deep recession of the 1980s: &quot;Please Lord, let there be another oil boom and we promise not to piss it away this time.&quot;Mark CarneyBank of EnglandCanadaAmericasOilCommoditiesGlobal economyEconomicsFinancial crisisBankingFinancial sectorFred GoodwinHeather Stewartguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="The shadow chancellor's pledge to match coalition cuts smacks of a failure of nerve. Perhaps Ed Balls should re-read his celebrated Bloomberg speech of 2010Has the Labour party thrown in the towel? Are rightwing commentators correct in claiming that recent speeches by Ed Miliband and Ed Balls amount to surrender? Given the strength of Balls's compelling case against the coalition's austerity programme – from that prescient Bloomberg lecture in August 2010 onwards – the news that Labour intends to stick to the coalition's spending plans for 2015-16, essentially acquiescing in a policy it had successfully ridiculed, is disturbing, to put it mildly.That celebrated Bloomberg lecture drew reluctant admiration from no less a Conservative figure than Alexander &quot;Boris&quot; Johnson, who noted that George Osborne's warnings of a Greek-style sovereign debt crisis and cripplingly high interest rates proved wide of the mark. At the time Johnson, taking Balls seriously, expressed fears of a double-dip recession and called for the government to go easy on its austerity programme.We now seem to be witnessing a collective failure of nerve. At just the moment when even the International Monetary Fund is owning up to having got it wrong, Labour, fearful of entering the next election campaign being pilloried as the spending party, gives the impression of being trapped in the headlights. And just for good measure, those highly respected independent thinktanks, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Institute for Government, have lamely accepted that it is going to be a case of &quot;austerity, austerity, austerity&quot; for the remainder of the decade.One commentator has compared the situation to 1976, when the chancellor, Denis Healey, turned back at Heathrow rather than fly to an IMF meeting in Manila. The IMF people who mattered were closer to home, and there was an almighty crisis. Conservative commentators never tire of quoting the speech by prime minister Jim Callaghan to the Labour conference in the midst of that crisis, when he said that the days of spending one's way out of recession were gone. But, as Callaghan made clear in his memoirs, that speech was entirely tactical.The fact of the matter is that the only way an economy can emerge from depression is by spending its way out. And if the banking system has, to all intents and purposes, gone absent without leave, and the private sector is in the doldrums, then the public sector has to step in. Month by month, analysts grasp at straws whenever there is an economic indicator suggesting that there could possibly be the beginnings of an upturn. But in the early stages of a traditional economic recovery one should be looking for a sustained growth rate of two, three or four percent, until the huge amount of slack in the economy – idle plant, unused machinery, unemployed people desperate for work – is absorbed.Yet that most reputable of think-tanks, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which recently celebrated its 75th birthday, observes in its May review: &quot;The absence of a sustained period of robust growth has plagued the UK economy since the end of the 'Great Recession' in the second quarter of 2009.&quot;That was the time when, with world trade collapsing at a rate of 20% per annum, G20 policymakers, with Gordon Brown at the helm, steered the world economy back on course, with the aid of a $1 trillion collective stimulus. Brown wanted to maintain the stimulus: the US government did, but the 2010 coalition did not, in the name of budgetary consolidation. The US budget position improved dramatically with economic growth while the British deficit, in the absence of decent growth, continues to be an embarrassment. As Niesr notes about this country: &quot;Economic performance is perhaps better described as 'stagnant'.&quot; The coalition is presiding over the worst recovery ever.In his 2010 speech, Balls rightly said the deficit and level of national debt must be tackled eventually, &quot;but only once growth is fully secured and over a markedly longer period than George Osborne is currently planning&quot;.Growth at this stage is manifestly not fully secured. The coalition is planning drastic cuts for 2015-16 without having the faintest idea whether the economy will have emerged from depression. For Labour to commit itself to acceptance of those cuts at this stage is economically unwise. Some political correspondents may salute the Opposition for heading off Conservative criticism, and listening to ill-informed focus groups, but this is all spin.As Balls said himself in 2010 of the banking crisis, the country &quot;has been through a once-in-a-generation event like the second world war … it was possible for our postwar government to have the wisdom and foresight to recognise the benefits of a slower, steadier approach to reducing an even bigger debt.&quot;The temptation for an electorate that has heard Labour attack austerity for three years, and now learns about what appears to be a major U-turn, is to ask: so what is the difference between the parties?Well, there is a difference. It was reported a few weeks ago that Labour had abandoned its plan to cut VAT. What Ed Balls actually said in his speech on 3 June was: &quot;Today, with growth prospects still very uncertain … a temporary VAT cut now is still the right prescription … &quot;Unfortunately, Labour is not in a position to make a temporary VAT cut. Without a major boost to demand, the situation in 2015-16 could still be one of a barely perceptible recovery from depression – which makes the adoption of plans for further spending cuts look all the more eccentric.AusterityEd BallsEconomic policyEconomicsLiberal-Conservative coalitionConservativesLiberal DemocratsWilliam Keeganguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="Locally grown food, community-owned power stations, local currencies … can small-scale actions make a difference? Yes, according to the Transition network – in fact, it's our only hopeLate last year, Rob Hopkins went to a conference. Most of the delegates were chief executive officers at local authorities, but it was not a public event. Speaking in confidence, three-quarters of these officials admitted that – despite what they say publicly – they could not foresee a return to growth in the near future.&quot;One said: 'If we ever get out of this recession, nothing will be as it was in the past,'&quot; Hopkins recalls. &quot;Another said: 'Every generation has had things better than its parents. Not any more.' But the one that stunned me said: 'No civilisation has lasted for ever. There is a very real chance of collapse.'&quot;Shocking stuff – shocking enough to leave many people feeling hopeless. And Hopkins has heard MPs and others in positions of power confess to similar fears in private. But the co-founder of the Transition Town movement is determined to offer courage and inspiration, and to do that he has published a short book, The Power of Just Doing Stuff, showing what people are already doing to develop a more resilient economy.For instance, a Transition group in Brixton raised ?130,000 to install the UK's first inner-city, community-owned power station, consisting of 82kW of solar panels on top of a council estate. Agroup in Derbyshire created a food hub that makes it economically viable to grow food in back gardens for sale, as an affordable alternative to supermarkets. And groups in Totnes, Stroud, Lewes, Brixton and Bristol launched their own local currencies. Taken on their own, these initiatives may not make a vast difference. &quot;But when there are thousands of communities worldwide all weaving their bit in a larger tapestry,&quot; Hopkins says, &quot;it adds up to something awe-inspiring and strong.&quot;What he is arguing is that sweeping changes in history are made not only by &quot;big&quot; people doing big things but by groups of &quot;ordinary&quot; people doing smaller things together. And that it's amistake to overlook those small steps.&quot;There is no cavalry coming to the rescue,&quot; he says. &quot;But what happens when ordinary people decide that they are the cavalry? Between the things we can do as individuals, and the things government and business can do to respond to the challenges of our times, lies a great untapped potential. It's about what you can create with the help of the people who live in your street, your neighbourhood, your town. If enough people do it, it can lead to real impact, to real jobs and real transformation of the places we live, and beyond.&quot;The Transition network was founded in 2005, as a response to the twin threats of climate change and peak oil. Unlike other campaign groups, the Transition network never set out to frighten people, but seemed resolutely upbeat, determined to find opportunity in what most regard with dismay.One of the movement's most fundamental ideas was to ask what the world might look like in the future &quot;if we get it right&quot; – then work out backwards how to get there. Generally speaking, the Transition vision is of a move towards self-sufficiency at the local level, in food, energy and much else, but the specifics of what &quot;getting it right&quot; might look like were never handed down from above.Every so often, well-meaning people give Hopkins advice. &quot;They say, you need to set up a political party, and have politicians everywhere, and set up the bank of Transition, and a Transition power company. And I think, yeah, or what we could do is have every community build its own energy company, or bank. And that's much more powerful.&quot;Transition is like a huge open-source research and development project, he says. &quot;Different groups try different things, and if an idea works, it spreads.&quot;During seven years, the movement hasattracted high-profile supporters. Transition gives &quot;great grounds for optimism,&quot; says Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, &quot;on topics that are often rather doom-laden&quot;. Jonathan Dimbleby concurs: &quot;Once upon a time, it was tempting to mock the idea of a Transition Town, but if ever there was an idea whose time has come, this is it.&quot;And Transition is not just a British phenomenon. There are more than 1,000 Transition initiatives in more than 40 countries. Fans include Ed Miliband and former German president Horst K?hler – an economist by profession, and former president of the IMF. Next month, Hopkins will appear at a conference with France's president and prime minister.Filipa Leao Pimentel is involved in Transition in Portugal, but is based in Brussels and works to explain Transition to MEPs. Recently, she arranged for members of an economic and social committee to spend a day with Transition initiatives in their own countries. &quot;Ihave lived in Brussels for years, and Ihave never seen anything like the discussion that came afterwards. There was a Greek who visited Portugal and she was touched by how we dealt with the crisis. One of the most conservative members talked about his 'journey'. Later, he said to me: 'Can you believe it, I talked about this as &quot;my journey&quot;?!'&quot;When the Transition movement started, it was driven by green politics, and its biggest critics have tended to bedeep greens. One, the writer Ted Trainer, threw the movement into mild existential crisis in 2009, when he accused Transition of being merely reformist, and too &quot;easily accommodated within consumer-capitalist society without threatening it&quot;.Hopkins's response was, essentially, to plead guilty. &quot;For years, in the green movement, we have held that we are right, that we have the answers … [But] many of the answers we need are to be found in people who we might, in a more judgmental moment, see as being part of the 'system', including business people, lawyers, church groups, local history groups, and thousands of ordinary people with busy lives, billstopay and children to raise.&quot;Today, Hopkins says he will only know that his new book has succeeded if his ideas are taken up by those kinds of people. Indeed, he wrote the book with his own sister in mind. &quot;I hope she won't mind me saying that! She's raising kids, she's very busy. She is somebody for whom all this stuff would pass her by. Not interesting at all. But if Transition is going to get anywhere, itneeds to reach people like her.&quot;In the biggest, most successful Transition groups, every effort is made to avoid being worthy. The Tooting group's first big event was a big street celebration, a Trashcatcher's Carnival, with Arts Council funding. &quot;In Topsham, in Devon, they asked: 'What is it that unites people in this town? Is it peak oil, or is it beer?' And they started a brewery. What are you inviting people to be part of? A group that talks about climate change? Or a historic, celebratory rethink about a place and what it does?&quot;The key thing is to find ways to bring people together. &quot;In Totnes, we started to change the narrative: how do we create a culture of entrepreneurship, and support young people? And all kinds of new people came in.&quot;At the first Local Entrepreneurs Forum, local business people gave advice to would-be entrepreneurs. But later they switched to a Community of Dragons, in which enterprises pitched to the entire community. And on the basis that &quot;everybody is an investor&quot;, individuals pledged support in the form of time, cash, land, support, services and more.The localisation movement has not always been good at talking about economics, Hopkins says. &quot;If Tesco wants to open a branch in my town, they can say it will bring jobs and so on. The localisation movement never tends to do that, they just say localisation is a great idea, it's sustainable, it's good for the community. So we tried to map the local economy and put a value on it. Here in Totnes we spend ?30m on food every year, of which ?22m goes through two supermarkets. It's like water running through our fingers, going to banks and offshore investors. But it could be staying local. If we spent just 10% of that locally, we'd have ?2.2m staying in the local economy to be spent again.&quot;Could a hospital that buys four tonnes of lettuce every year get that locally? If it uses energy, could it use a local energy company? We're looking at different ways of investing internally.&quot;One powerful way to prevent money leaking from a community's economy is by using local currencies. Businesses in Bristol can pay their rates in &quot;Bristol pounds&quot;, and the city council gives staff the option to take part of their salary in B?s. The new mayor, George Ferguson, announced at his inauguration last November that he would take his entiresalary in B?s, which can only be spent in Bristol. Morethan ?180,000 has been turned into B?s, estimated to be worth ?1.8m inlocal economic activity.This new emphasis on economic development has galvanised the Transition Town movement, and not only in the UK. &quot;The economic crisis helped us to gather so many people,&quot; says Pimentel. &quot;In Portugal, we are under water. There is no money. You seeyour country starting to sink, and you close down, waiting for it to pass – but this is not going to pass. Transition was our framework to give people something to do. Instead of thinking, 'My god, we are sinking,' we said: 'Let's do this.' Little steps are important.&quot;Important because they contribute tosomething bigger – the &quot;larger tapestry&quot; Hopkins talks about – but also important because it's small steps that help people recognise that they have power to make a difference. &quot;Starting a vegetable garden in the street is small,&quot; Pimentel says. &quot;But what is incredible isthat when people learn to do that, they start to have confidence.&quot;The key thing is persistence. What people tell me now is, 'I thought that you were going to fail, and you did not.' They say: 'It's really true that doing little things, step by step, makes a difference.' And when they say that, I smile. I feel very proud. So even if things seem small, or you think it will not make abigdifference, just persist.&quot;Transition townsSustainable developmentEntrepreneursSmall businessFoodFood  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="Antonis Samaras tries to calm political crisis by offering partial reinstatement so transmissions can resume 'immediately'Greece's prime minister, Antonis Samaras, attempted late on Friday night to end the turmoil over his decision to close the country's public broadcaster – with a proposal to partially reinstate the company so it could resume transmissions &quot;immediately&quot;.The proposed closure of the Hellenic Broadcasting Company (ERT) has led to the conservative leader facing his worst political crisis since assuming power a year ago.He announced the apparent climbdown in the hope it would stem the public protests that have once again put Athens in the eye of the storm.&quot;To find a solution to the issue … I propose that a temporary committee of broad parliamentary acceptance be appointed,&quot; he said in a statement.The committee, he suggested, should be set up &quot;with the express purpose of hiring a small number of [ERT] employees so that the broadcast of news programmes can begin immediately&quot;.But instead of calming tensions, his offer inflamed them. Within hours, his two centre-left coalition partners rejected the offer, reinforcing speculation that they would walk out of the uneasy alliance now ruling Greece if ERT is not quickly reopened.Dimitris Trimis, the head of the country's association of journalists, ESEA, described the compromise as being &quot;totally insufficient&quot;.He said: &quot;It proves that he is under tremendous pressure but it falls far short of the demands of unions and ERT employees who have already experienced huge cutbacks.&quot;He still wants to go ahead with his plans to radically restructure the organisation.&quot;Prior to his announcement, Samaras had come under immense pressure, both at home and abroad, to switch the state-run channel back on.Describing ERT as a huge drain on the public purse, he had previously insisted the broadcaster, which employs 2,700, would not be reopened until it had been overhauled in line with the demands of Greece's &quot;troika&quot; of creditors – the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the EU,Earlier on Friday, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) had urged Samaras to reverse his decision after emergency talks in Athens.&quot;We ask the government to re-establish the signal on TV, radio and web,&quot; said the body's president Jean-Paul Philippot, noting it was the first time in the history of Europe that a country had elected to shut down its own broadcaster.Across the continent officials have also expressed dismay at the move made when the broadcaster was transmitting live late on Tuesday.Berlin, which has bankrolled most of the bailout funds propping up the debt-stricken Greek economy, is said to be outraged at the prospect of political crisis in Athens shattering the calm before Germans go to the polls in September.With all sides digging in their heels, the spectre of elections had become a real possibility.&quot;No one, with the exception of [neo-Nazi and fast-growing] Golden Dawn, wants elections in this country,&quot; said political scientist Dimitris Kerides.&quot;It was absolutely expedient that Samaras found a way to back down without losing face.&quot;Analysts did not rule out the compromise being used as a bargaining chip ahead of crucial talks between all three coalition leaders on Monday.Samaras, addressing the youth wing of his own centre-right party on Friday, accused those who defended the broadcaster of being &quot;hypocrites,&quot; likening ERT to a den of &quot;sin … and scandals that our people will learn&quot;.The public prosecutor's office had ordered an official probe into the widespread corruption and malpractice that had bedevilled the company, he said.GreeceEuropeEuropean UnionERTInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)EconomicsEuropean Central BankEuropean monetary unionHelena Smithguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="In the 1990s, we had a life today's 25-year-olds can't even image. Now we are in the 'sandwich generation'A quote from NME's Tom Howard in the publicity for Made In Stone, Shane Meadows' recently released Stone Roses documentary, says &quot;grown men will cry&quot;. It's probably 30 years since I trusted the opinion of an NME reviewer, but here's the thing: I am now inconceivably (if only to me) almost 50 and a grown woman, but the trailer alone for Meadows's film made me cry.So, to clarify: the Stone Roses are not a boy thing, they're a generational thing. If, for the sake of argument, the Clash's London Calling was the last great LP of the 1970s and came to be thought of as a 1980s album, then the Stone Roses's eponymous debut was the last great album of the 1980s, yet became synonymous with the 1990s.It is also the last album for which I feel some sort of (skin-of-my-teeth) generational ownership. Funnily enough, until last week when my dad gave me his turntable I hadn't owned one since about 1992, so I doubt I've listened to my 12-inch copy of Fool's Gold since then. And God, but it sounds good and likewise makes me cry, and I know precisely why that is – it's because this slightly scratched piece of black plastic contains the last-gasp soundtrack of my entire bloody youth and, nearly 25 years later, &quot;ahhh, Bisto!&quot; doesn't come close to describing the smell of that nostalgia.In short, I was young once and that was mostly good. Even if, back then, I'd stopped believing in NME reviews, I did still very much believe in the music. Now that I am so unconnected to that place, emotionally and physically, its soundtrack inevitably sort of hurts.As well as the Meadows documentary there's another film out about their &quot;legendary&quot; – I recall it was very self-consciously described as &quot;legendary&quot; almost immediately – Spike Island gig. So the Stone Roses are having a moment – as is, perhaps inevitably, all the Manchester music born of the previous recession.And that was a very different recession; one which allowed me to leave my job as an editor at the Face magazine in 1989 and enrol on a degree course at King's College London on a full student grant, which, in turn, meant that my then partner, a magazine editor, and I could pay the mortgage on our tiny one-bed flat in Shepherd's Bush. So as a &quot;mature&quot; student with a full grant and a fashionable endowment mortgage, compared to the average 25-year-old today, I was living the dream.But now of course the old Roses fans, mostly 40ish, are recession-squeezed members of the &quot;sandwich generation&quot;, with their own mortgages and young dependent children (they came to parenting late, what with spending every weekend in their 20s in a field taking ecstasy) and parents old enough to benearly as dependent as their kids.And for them it's all gone a bit PeteTongon the work front too, withyet another round of bloody redundancies and all their credit cards maxed on 0%-interest-for-18-months deals. As if that weren't bad enough, the weather's always shit these days (itwas better back then, surely?) and they still can't afford a holiday abroad, for the third year running (remember Ibiza? Those were the days).But stick on the Stone Roses – CD or vinyl, it matters not – and the opening bars of I Wanna Be Adored will make theRoses generation smile and tap a foot and then, despite themselves, get up and do some embarrassing dad-dancing (and indeed mum-dancing too), and so before you know it they can squint and it is a warm Sunday afternoon in 1990 and they're one of 27,000 standing on a breezy island in the Mersey estuary waiting for the opening bars. And it's good to be back there, isn't it? Yeah, even for those of us who weren't eventhere in the first place.Stone RosesRecessionEconomicsManchesterKathryn Flettguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="Around 200 people occupied one of London's key financial districts as part of a range of anti-G8 protestsOne of London's key financial districts saw its biggest ever protest on Friday as an estimated 200 people occupied Canary Wharf to protest against public spending cuts and lack of action against climate change.Among the protesters were pensioners, children, people with disabilities, a brass band, musicians and a range of groups including Fuel Poverty Action, Disabled People Against Cuts, the Greater London Pensioners Association, No Dash for Gas and UK Uncut.A spokeswoman for the event said: &quot;We picked Canary Wharf because it's a symbol of out-of-control neoliberal capitalism. It's completely private property where protests have been outlawed. We've come here because we want to pull together anti-capitalist, climate and anti-austerity struggles.&quot;The owner of Canary Wharf has previously taken legal action and put in place security measures to prevent protests in home of some of Britain's biggest banks. The action was part of a range of anti-G8 protests currently taking place, but unlike other events this one passed peacefully.Protesters erected and scaled bamboo tripods – structures designed to prevent attempts to clear the area by force. An assembly, speeches and workshops were held, as well as creative activities, music and poetry performances and guerilla gardening.James Granger, of Fuel Poverty Action, who helped organise the event, said the banks and financial institutions in Canary Wharf are &quot;bankrolling fossil fuel projects across the world which are causing climate change and fuel poverty&quot;.&quot;The price of fossil fuels is increasing, which is leading to one-quarter of the UK population facing the choice between heating and eating,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm here to say that there is an alternative – renewable energy which is cheaper and cleaner, and an economy that works for the needs of people not the needs of profit.&quot;Betty Cottingham of the Greater London Pensioners Association said: &quot;I'm here to protest along with the young and middle-aged people about what this lot are doing to our world. There's going to be 3,000 extra deaths this winter because pensioners and other people daren't turn the heating on.&quot;A Canary Wharf banker, who did not wish to be named, said he did not make the link between banking and the recession. &quot;If it hadn't been caused by banking it would have been caused but something else,&quot; he said. &quot;I think these people are here because they care about what's going on out there and the recession has given them a justification to get out here and do this.&quot;ActivismProtestClimate changeLondonBankingAusterityEconomicsG8guardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="Tucker, who lost out on the governor job to Mark Carney, will leave the central bank in the autumnPaul Tucker, the deputy governor of the Bank of England who lost out on the top job to Canadian Mark Carney, announced on Friday that he will leave Threadneedle Street in the autumn, after &quot;providing support&quot; to the new governor during his first few months in the post.Tucker was widely expected to step down after failing to secure the governorship, but his five year term was not due to end until next February.In his resignation letter to the chancellor, he said: &quot;I am immensely proud to have had the opportunity to make a contribution to public policy over the past three decades.&quot;In his reply, George Osborne, whose decision to headhunt Carney from Canada thwarted Tucker's long-held ambition to lead the Bank of England, said: &quot;I have no doubt that you will continue to make a towering contribution to the international economic community.&quot;With another of the Bank's three deputy governors, Charlie Bean, due to leave at the end of June next year, Carney will now be able to put his stamp on the Bank by appointing two of his senior lieutenants within twelve months.Erik Britton, a former Bank economist and now a director of City consultancy Fathom, said: &quot;The interesting thing is who Carney will want as a successor: it may be that he's a new broom in a number of senses, not only shaking up the old thinking, but shaking out the people who were associated with it.&quot;But fresh evidence that Carney may face opposition if he wants to push for more economic stimulus came in a speech yesterday from independent monetary policy committee member Ian McCafferty.McCafferty warned that the Bank must guard its reputation carefully, and prevent the public's fears of rising inflation from getting out of control. &quot;In this environment, I believe it is important to continue to be mindful of the need to keep expectations well-anchored when setting policy,&quot; he said.According to a statement released by the Bank, Tucker plans to spend some time in US academia, but his name is also likely to be linked with top banking jobs, such as the soon to be vacant chairman's role at Lloyds Banking Group.As deputy governor responsible for financial stability, Tucker has acted as the Bank's eyes and ears in the City. His closeness to the financial sector exposed him to criticism during the Libor-fixing scandal, when he was called before the Treasury select committee to explain his dealings with Barclays boss Bob Diamond.The committee largely exonerated Tucker; but the release of a series of emails, including one in which he referred to Diamond as, &quot;an absolute brick&quot;, raised questions about his cosy relationship with the City.Andrew Tyrie, the Conservative chairman of the treasury select committee, said: &quot;Paul Tucker has done an outstanding job, not least in helping shape the international framework for bank resolution, a vital part of the regulatory response to the crisis.&quot;The outgoing governor, Sir Mervyn King, said: &quot;Paul's contribution to the Bank, to monetary policy and more generally to public policy, both in the UK and in the world as a whole, has been enormous.&quot;Former monetary policy committee member Kate Barker: &quot;He will be missed; he's done a really good job; he's very devoted to the Bank, and worked tirelessly.&quot; She added that the 55-year old could yet return to Threadneedle Street. &quot;I can't see him being in academia for long – he's young enough not to go from the Bank for ever.&quot; The new governor has made clear that he will only serve five years of his eight-year term. Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC and a former Bank economist, said, &quot;I'm sure a return to public policy is likely.&quot;Carney, who has worked closely with Tucker at the international Financial Stability Board, which is re-writing global bank regulation, said: &quot;I wish Paul every success in the next phase of his career and look forward to maintaining our close dialogue on how to build a more resilient financial system that more effectively serves the needs of the real economy.&quot;Internal candidates to replace Tucker include markets director Paul Fisher, and Andy Haldane, director for financial stability. Haldane has made a series of well-received interventions into public debate since the onset of the financial crisis, but has clashed with Carney over the future of regulation.Who's next?It was the way to bet. Paul Tucker was hot favourite to succeed Sir Mervyn King as governor of the Bank of England, but he lost to a younger man.In the circumstances, it was always unlikely that he would hang around to watch Mark Carney perform. The interesting question is who will succeed Tucker as deputy governor for financial stability.One internal candidate towers above others. He is Andrew Haldane, a brainbox who can talk in plain English. But Carney and Haldane have history.The new governor didn't like Haldane's famous &quot;dog catching a frisbee&quot; speech (it's all about timing), in which he argued that the new Basel 3 rules on banking are too complex. Since Carney is head of the Financial Stability Board, which set the rules, he was bound to be irritated.Have they made up? We'll find out. Haldane is the best choice. Carney would be a smaller figure if he blocked the appointment.Bank of EnglandPaul TuckerEconomicsEconomic policyMark CarneyBankingBanking reformMervyn KingRegulatorsHeather Stewartguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="Department for Work and Pensions data shows median income is at lowest level for a decade due to pay freezes and austerityBritain has suffered a &quot;lost decade&quot; in living standards after a second year of sharp falls in inflation-adjusted pay pushed incomes back to levels last seen in the early 2000s, according to official figures released on Thursday.Data from the Department for Work and Pensions showed that two successive years in which real incomes dropped by 3% per annum wiped out modest gains made in the previous eight years and pushed an extra 1 million people below the absolute poverty line.The DWP's annual report on households living below average income showed median income at ?427 a week in 2011-12. When adjusted for inflation, this was slightly below the ?429 in 2001-02 and well down on the ?454 peak in median income in 2009-10.Pay freezes and &quot;economic restructuring&quot; during the deep and the prolonged slump were the main causes of the fall in living standards, the DWP said.The figures showed that absolute poverty among children rose by 300,000, with two-thirds of those living in households with one or more earners.Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: &quot;Despite all the talk about 'scroungers' and generations of families never working, today's poverty figures expose comprehensively the myth that the main cause of poverty is people choosing not to work.&quot;The truth is that for a growing number of families, work isn't working. The promise that work would be a route out of poverty has not been kept as wages stagnate and spending cuts have hurt low-income working families.&quot;Falls in income affected those on high, low and middle pay, leaving income inequality unchanged between 2010-11 and 2011-12. Using the relative poverty yardstick, the number of children living in households with incomes of less than 60% of the national median remained unchanged at the lowest level since the mid-1980s.Anita Tiessen, deputy executive director of Unicef UK, pointed out that the figures predate said: &quot;The number of children living in poverty in the UK is likely to be even higher than the government's statistics suggest. In the time period covered by today's figures, major austerity measures – like council tax benefit cuts and the introduction of the bedroom tax – had not yet come into force, so this data does not reflect their probable harmful impact on children's wellbeing.&quot;The IFS said the fall in real incomes would have been smaller had an alternative to the Retail Prices Index been used to make the inflation-adjusted comparisons. Even so, it added, real incomes in 2011-12 would have returned to 2004-05 levels.More detailed analysis of the government's figures by the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals a stark generational divide in the way incomes have been affected since the onset of recession. Older people – those in their 60s and 70s – have fared best, and have actually seen their average incomes rise, by 2%-3%, between 2007-08 and 2011-12.Those in their 20s have been the worst-affected age group, reflecting the fact that unemployment rates for younger workers have been relatively high. Their average income declined by as much as 12% between 2007-8 and 2011-12, after adjusting for inflation.The IFS said this pattern continued a long-term trend in the run-up to the crisis. People in their 20s saw their incomes stagnate from 2001 onwards as wages flatlined, while rising spending on pensions helped to insulate the elderly.The fresh evidence that younger people have been hit hardest by the crisis is likely to rekindle arguments about whether the elderly have got off lightly.David Phillips, senior research economist at the IFS, said substantial changes in the welfare system had helped to reduce relative poverty rates among both pensioners and children over the past fifteen years. Once their lower housing costs are taken into account, pensioners are now at less risk of falling into relative poverty than working-age adults.&quot;This is in many ways a triumph of social policy. But these figures also confirm that it is young people who have suffered most as a result of the recent recession and who are now at risk of falling further behind. It is important that policymakers and politicians understand these profound changes to patterns of low incomes and respond accordingly.&quot;EconomicsPovertySocial exclusionPayWelfareEconomic policyChild protectionChildrenSocial careFamily financesConsumer affairsLarry ElliottHeather Stewartguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="Uphill struggle for prime minister over tax havens, EU-US trade talks and Syrian peace conferenceDavid Cameron's key objectives at the G8 summit next week – cracking down on tax havens, launching EU-US trade talks and progress to a Syrian peace conference – were still meeting resistance on Thursday as he battled to win over key allies.The prime minister is chairing the G8 summit in Northern Ireland on Monday and Tuesday next week, and is battling to break through the interlocking diplomatic and economic agendas. He looked to be closer to a breakthough on improving tax co-operation in UK overseas territories and crown dependencies.Bermuda joined the British Virgin Islands by apparently accepting that it should sign an existing OECD agreement to transfer tax information on request. The tax justice and aid charities have been pushing Downing Street hard to get the UK Overseas Territories to commit, and see it as essential of the UK is to have wider credibility on the tax justice agenda. The Bermudan premier, Craig Cannonier, said: &quot;I want to clarify that Bermuda is strongly committed to joining the multilateral convention on tax information sharing.&quot;Bermuda is a well regulated jurisdiction and has always been at the forefront of international efforts to fight tax evasion and aggressive tax avoidance. I am encouraged that other overseas territories are also committed to joining the convention.&quot;Earlier Cannonier had hinted that he was only willing to agree to sign in principle.Downing Street officials admitted that the revelation in the Guardian last week of Cameron's plan to summon the crown dependencies to a meetingbefore the G8 summit itself in a bid to press them to end tax secrecy had led to resistance from some countries.The prime minister was meeting continued resistance from his Canadian counterpart, Stephen Harper, over critical plans to require countries to reveal the true beneficial owners of shell companies and trusts. The measure is vital to combatting money laundering, fighting tax evasion and turning tax information exchange into something meaningful.Cameron laid on the diplomatic red carpet for Harper, giving him the rare honour of speaking to both houses of parliament, a visit to the Queen and a lengthy bilateral meeting at Downing Street. But Harper is worried about exposing private Canadian tax affairs and fears complications arising from Canada's federal structure.In a crucial advance for Cameron, a US Treasury spokesman said: &quot;We view the G8 as an important opportunity to make progress on cracking down on criminal and illicit actors who use shell companies to hide their true identity.&quot;The US Treasury said &quot;Increased transparency including the availability of beneficial information to law enforcement is an essential element of the US broader effort to enhance financial transparency which also includes strengthening customer due dilligence requirements for US financial institutions with respect to beneficial ownership of legal entity account holders&quot;.The remarks suggest that Barack Obama is not going to support public registries of beneficial ownership, limiting access to tax authorities.Cameron is also hoping to launch EU-US trade talks on Monday, but in an attempt to persuade a reluctant French government to give the go-ahead for the talks, the European commission is ready to give EU governments, including France, a much greater say in negotiations.On Syria, Cameron is hoping that bilateral talks with President Vladimir Putin on Sunday could lead to a breakthrough on a peace conference. Cameron's tax wishlist at G81. Strong G8 political support for a new OECD action plan due to be given to G20 finance ministers in July setting out how to end corporation tax loopholes covering issues such as transfer pricing, intellectual property and country by country reporting.

G8 political support to develop worldwide standard on automatic tax information transfer based on a pilot agreed, but not implemented between the US, G5 and some UK Crown dependencies. This currently excludes developing countries.4. A G8 agreement on beneficial ownership, a means of revealing the true identity of shell companies, mainly in tax havens.

      <text text="Bank insiders believe their new boss has a mandate for change, but he is faced with a formidable set of challengesIf George Osborne had wanted a &quot;no change&quot; candidate to squire the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street gently through the next five years, he could have opted for any of several high-flying Brits, including well-respected deputy governor Paul Tucker. Instead, Bank insiders believe Mark Carney has been handed a mandate for change.The chancellor is hoping Carney will shake things up on at least three fronts – and on all of them the Canadian faces serious challenges.Monetary policyFirst, there is monetary policy-making. The Bank has created an extraordinary ?375bn of money through its unprecedented programme of quantitative easing, yet GDP remains more than 2% below its pre-crisis level, making this the weakest recovery from any recession in a century.There has been some cause for optimism, according to recent data, including the slight fall in unemployment in the latest labour market figures. But Carney stresses the importance of economies reaching &quot;escape velocity&quot;, which looks a long way off.Yet if he hopes to jumpstart the recovery through more monetary stimulus he will have to persuade the monetary policy committee to back him – and six members have repeatedly rejected Sir Mervyn King's calls for a fresh ?25bn of quantitative easing in recent months.As Simon Wells, UK economist at HSBC, puts it: &quot;To start voting for easing they probably need a better reason than 'the new governor wants me to'.&quot;In Canada, Carney pioneered the &quot;forward guidance&quot; approach. As the economy began to pick up in 2009 investors and mortgage borrowers fretted that interest rates would rise; the Bank of Canada responded by publicly promising to keep borrowing costs on hold (provided inflation didn't take off) for a further year.Osborne has asked the Bank to decide by August whether it would like to adopt a similar approach. But here, too, Carney may face opposition from MPC members, several of whom have expressed scepticism about the idea.At the Bank of Canada there is a governing council that discusses monetary policy, but no minutes are published, no vote is taken, and what the governor says, goes.And even if the economy starts recovering strongly at some point during Carney's five-year term he will have to face the fraught question of how to extricate the Bank from its ?375bn money-creating spree without sparking a sharp rise in interest rates across financial markets.Any hint that the Bank is readying itself to sell off some of its huge government bond portfolio, or to push up interest rates, is likely to cause bond investors to take flight, pushing up borrowing costs and potentially putting any recovery at risk.Fixing the banksThe second fraught area for Carney is Britain's battered financial system. The Bank of England has been handed back the responsibility for supervising the banks, lost in 1997, and the newly-fledged Prudential Regulation Authority will be under his remit.The authority will have to oversee implementation of the Vickers reforms, which will fundamentally redraw the shape of the UK banking system, imposing a ringfence between banks' high-street operations and their investment arms, which are perceived to be riskier.Meanwhile, Osborne is charging headlong towards privatisating the bailed-out Lloyds and RBS banks, and the new financial policy committee is involved in a controversial debate over its decision to force banks to raise more capital.So Carney takes over a bank supervisory regime in flux, at a time when the rules are changing, and the banks are far from recovered from the ravages of the great recession.Fixing the BankThe changes to the Bank's remit are also relevant to Carney's third big challenge: fixing the culture of an entity that many feel has become too hierarchical, fusty and out of touch.Alistair Darling, who had a series of run-ins with Carney's predecessor, King, during the financial crisis, referred to the latter as the &quot;sun king&quot;, with untrammelled power in Threadneedle Street.The Bank has already changed radically since the downturn hit. But Carney will be expected to bring the institution into the 21st century.A public survey, published in the Bank of England quarterly bulletin, shows that while public confidence in the institution has grown, the sharp drop that occurred with the onset of the crisis has yet to be reversed.Fewer than half of households – 35% to 40% – said, in this survey, that they were &quot;fairly or very satisfied&quot; with the way the Bank was doing its job, and 20% to 30% were &quot;fairly or very dissatisfied&quot;. The new governor will be hoping to improve those ratings.Even for someone with Carney's impressive reputation, these appear a formidable set of challenges. But as Craig Wright, the Royal Bank of Canada's chief economist, puts it: &quot;Firefighters go where the fires are.&quot;Mark CarneyBank of EnglandEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsEconomic policyGreen shootsFinancial policy committeeHeather Stewartguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="Stephen Hester wanted to turn RBS back into a normal bank but, after ?45bn, the government can do what it likesThe silly response to Stephen Hester's exit as boss of RBS is to say that politicians should not meddle with banks. The truth is the opposite. Banks should not meddle with politicians.Remember who started this. The banks in the early 2000s behaved with a recklessness I believe should still be regarded as criminal. A number went bust and ran pleading to the state, hollering that they were too big to fail. The terrorism proved effective. The banks told the politicians that, if taxpayers did not bail them out, then taxpayers would suffer, which meant that politicians would suffer on their behalf. They were indeed bailed out and their bosses laughed all the way back to their respective safe deposits, their pockets stuffed with other people's money. On the topic of political interference, banks can shut up.Hester may feel personally bruised. He was quietly turning an honest penny wrecking London's skyline when he took the Queen's shilling to rescue RBS. It was an awful task, to salvage Britain's biggest finance house from the wreckage left by Gordon Brown's City favourite, Fred Goodwin.By most accounts Hester has done the right thing. He has turned a ?24bn loss into a modest profit. He has isolated some ?200bn of &quot;bad bank&quot; debt and shrunk it to ?40bn in four years. He has set the rest of RBS on the road to becoming what he this week called &quot;a normal bank&quot;.All this Hester did while enduring the cacophony of political static that now curses his business and his vocation. He has a bunch of amateur economists at Westminster holding 82% of his shares. He has ministers, MPs and committees snapping at his heels, telling him how to do his job. Hardly a month passes without some new horror emerging from the rotting entrails of his empire, such as insurance mis-selling, crashing computers and the Libor scandal.He has even had to suffer the archbishop of Canterbury, like the Renaissance Italian preacher Girolamo Savonarola lecturing the Medici, telling him his staff should be motivated by &quot;the fear of hell and the hope of heaven&quot; rather than by filthy lucre.Hester studied politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford. He should know that to run a British nationalised industry is to experience a madhouse. He did not help himself by catching the City's occupational disease – helpless greed for &quot;incentive&quot; bonuses. Friends might protest that he was not carrying off shed-loads of loot like his colleagues at Barclays and elsewhere, but he was running a state industry. Not even NHS bosses get ?5.6m to soften the blow of departure. Yet within the terms of his deal, Hester deserves credit and some sympathy.Where push apparently came to shove was whether RBS's path to privatisation was as swift as George Osborne wanted, and whether RBS had done as much for small businesses as Vince Cable wanted. Hester was planning an orderly return of the bank to normal City status, including a retained overseas and investment arm and a bonus culture. The government wanted none of this. It wanted RBS to lend like mad, shovel bad debts into a separate &quot;bad bank&quot; and have something lucrative to sell come election time.The reality is that ministers are desperate for growth and thought they had a vehicle to promote it – a bank of their own. Hester was under pressure to lend. He and his fellows were showered with cash under quantitative easing. But as long as Osborne and Cable, purveyors of austerity to the working classes, chose to starve firms of consumer demand, the banks were wary of resuming the crazy lending of yesteryear. Instead they sheltered the cash in the bond and stock markets, which are enjoying an unsteady boom.Osborne's March budget was a glaring illustration of this clash of government and banks. He pleaded with the latter to join his Help-to-Buy scheme, heading for precisely the sub-prime risk that led to the housing bubble in the first place. He even promised guarantees for new &quot;bad bank&quot; loans. Hester might have quoted Rudyard Kipling's warning to the capitalists of his day, as &quot;the burnt fool's bandaged finger goes wobbling back to the fire&quot;.Yet it was the banks that kindled the fire in the first place. They might be cautious now in not wanting to see it re-stoked, but they can hardly be surprised if ministers are frantic. RBS is a politicians' bank, one that must respond to political imperatives. Hester might have wanted to turn it into a normal bank, but it is not his bank to turn.The banking community has enjoyed extraordinary intellectual sway over Downing Street and the Treasury since the early years of the Blair government. It promoted the expansionary policies of the 2000s, lending with abandon and resisting tighter regulation. Banks seconded their executives to Whitehall, to secure billions in consultancy fees and PFI contracts. It was banks that boosted the deficit. When the balloon burst, it was banks that orchestrated the bailouts, shamelessly demanding bonuses to continue.Many politicians, the chancellor included, are plainly fed up. Having sunk ?45bn into RBS, they feel entitled to tell it what it should do: to get out of casino banking; stop paying reckless bonuses; and hive off its bad-bank arm. Whether the motives are short or long term, economic or political, ?45bn gives ministers the right to say what they want and have someone obey.Economic policy is at present like policy in war. When Hester went to RBS in 2008 it was a reprise of Earl Haig arriving at the western front in 1915. He faced catastrophe and the heat of public expectation was intense. Ministers were bound to second-guess every decision, tactical as well as strategic. Their futures depended on it. The stakes were too high for the delicacies of &quot;hands off&quot; delegation.Europe's current recession – surely soon to merit the status of depression – has its roots in the failure of one industry, that of banking. It has had to be rescued, at what is still an appalling human cost, by politicians across the entire continent.Britain's bankers may not welcome Osborne, Cable and others to the ranks of their profession. But at present there is only one stance they can adopt with any dignity: one of abject, unbounded, grovelling humility.Royal Bank of ScotlandBankingStephen HesterFinancial crisisEconomicsFinancial sectorEconomic policyGeorge OsborneVince CableSimon Jenkinsguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="If Gordon Brown had chosen to join the single currency 10 years ago, both the European Union and Britain would be stronger nowTen years ago this week Gordon Brown said no to joining the euro. It is an anniversary on which Bank of England governor Mervyn King, Ukip's Nigel Farage, Unite's Len McCluskey and the Guardian's Larry Elliott, along with most of the British economic establishment, can all agree. On this, Brown was right.Elliott set out the establishment consensus in a classic piece this month on his alternative history of what would have happened had Britain joined. Essentially, he says, there would have been a bigger boom in the runup to 2007 and a more disastrous bust. Britain would now be struggling to maintain its membership as anti-EU sentiment mushroomed, prompting itseventual exit, dramatising the inherent unsoundness of yoking disparate economies into one inflexible currency.But there is a more optimistic, alternative history. The first obvious point is that Britain could have joined the euro only if a referendum had been won. A victory would have depended on it being an obvious good deal, with the pound entering at a competitive rate and the euro's structure, rules and governance reformed to accommodate British concerns and interests. The European Central Bank would have needed to look more like the US Federal Reserve, with more scope for fiscal and monetary activism. The Germans would doubtless have insisted, in return, that the EU banking system be more conservatively managed.The last decade would have been very different. What none of the mockers of the euro ever acknowledge is the economic doomsday machine that Brown created through not joining. By not locking in a competitive pound, Britain suffered a decade of chronic sterling overvaluation, made more acute by the City of London sucking in capital from abroad to finance the extraordinary credit and property boom of those years.Imports surged and exports sagged; the economy outside banking, which made goods and services to be sold abroad, either stagnated or shrank. Much of the best of UK manufacturing was auctioned off to foreigners. Today we find that, despite a huge currency devaluation, there are just not enough companies to take advantage of it: too much of the rest of British capacity, thanks to foreign takeover, has become a part of global supply chains that are indifferent to exchange-rate variation. Our export response has been feeble; evidence of the economic orthodoxy's inability to devise policies and structures that favour production.Inside the euro, at a highly competitive exchange rate, Britain's exports would instead have soared, and its traded goods sector would have expanded, not shrunk. Regional cities would have boomed around sustainable activity rather than property and credit. The euro's rules would have meant a less reckless fiscal policy, and banks would have been more constrained in lending for property. They would have had to lend proportionately more to fast-growing real enterprise, reinforced because the new rules would have required them to lend in a more balanced way.Britain would have entered the 2008 crisis with a far less unbalanced economy, a stronger banking system and international accounts, and a government deficit much less acute. And the reformed eurozone could haveresponded much more flexibly andcleverly than it did.In any case, both Britain and Europe are now wrestling with depressed economic activity caused by overstretched bank and company balance sheets – and the exchange-rate regime is hardly the cause of this distress. Germany and the stronger EU countries are plainly wrong in their overemphasis on austerity as a solution, but surely right to argue that the only long-term solution is for the whole of Europe to move to their productivist, stakeholder capitalism.British mainstream commentators see the obvious fissure between the stronger European north and the weaker south as proof positive that the euro is fatally flawed. But suppose countries like Greece or Ireland rise to the German challenge? Already there are encouraging auguries in both. If so, notwithstanding excessive austerity, they could weather the crisis, and become stronger.There is plainly a chance one or more countries could leave, but there is a greater chance the system in some form will hold – it is in too many countries' interests to avoid failure. Then expect a pan-European recovery to begin in the second half of the decade that will gather strength in the 2020s.Inside the euro for the last decade, the economic and political debate would have necessarily moved on. Having won a historic referendum decisively affirming Britain's future in Europe, the Blair government would have had to think in European terms about how to produce, invest, innovate and export. Sure, there would have been problems. But Britain outside the euro in 2013, with endless spending cuts, the biggest fall in real wages for a century, 500,000 people relying on food banks, and a weak unbalanced economy, is hardly a land of milk and honey.Emboldened by his referendum victory, Blair could have sacked Brown before the disastrous second phase of his chancellorship and lacklustre prime ministership. Blairism would have morphed into a new form of European social democracy, fashioning British-style stakeholder capitalism. UK politics would not have moved so decisively to the right, with conservatives preaching free-market Thatcherism while the left clings to a bastard Keynesianism – united only in their belief, against all the evidence including Britain's export performance, that floating exchange rates are a universal panacea.A single currency demands disciplines and painful trade-offs: but floating exchange rates after a financial crisis are a transmission mechanism for bank-runs and beggar-my-neighbour devaluations. Magic bullets do not exist. Had Britain joined, both we and Europe would have been better placed, and Larry Elliott would now be writing about how better to get Britain to innovate and invest under a fourth-term Labour government.

      <text text="Nikkei's 6% decline triggers falls on other Asian bourses and European markets but nerves later steadied by US jobs figuresA plunge in shares in Tokyo prompted jitters in the world's emerging markets yesterday as investors expressed fresh concern about the Japanese government's recovery plan and the possible phasing out of America's stimulus programme.Japan's leading stock market index, the Nikkei, fell by more than 6%, extending the fall in recent weeks to more than 20%, the official definition of a bear market.The decline – accompanied by a rise in the Japanese yen on the foreign exchanges – triggered falls on other Asian bourses and led to early falls on European markets. But nerves were later steadied by stronger than expected jobs and retail sales figures from the US and the FTSE 100 in London ended the day five points higher at 6304.Economic reforms announced by the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe late last year prompted a hefty rise in share prices and a fall in the value of the yen. But in recent weeks, markets have started to voice doubts about the ability of Tokyo to use a bond-buying programme and fiscal expansion to lift the country out of deflation.Thursday's uneasy mood was not helped when the World Bank revised down its forecasts for global growth this year from 2.4% to 2.2%. Markets are now waiting to see whether next week's meeting of the Federal Reserve will provide clues as to when America's central bank might start to slacken the pace of its quantitative easing programme.Julian Jessop, chief global analyst at Capital Economics, said: &quot;Only a few weeks ago, the complaint was that the spill-over of liquidity from the advanced economies threatened to destabilise markets in the developing world. Now it seems as if the one thing worse than more QE is less QE. More seriously, emerging market equities have again demonstrated how hard it is for them to decouple from developed markets, particularly during a wider sell-off.&quot;Meanwhile, Portugal's deep recession and rising political tensions risk undermining the country's bailout programme, despite a fresh easing of its deficit targets, according to the International Monetary Fund.In its latest progress report on Portugal, the IMF confirmed that it has agreed Lisbon's tough deficit reduction goals should be loosened – by 1 percentage point in 2013, and 1.5 percentage points in 2014 – as the economy slows.&quot;In view of the significant deterioration in the macro-fiscal outlook, there was agreement that the fiscal deficit path under the programme needed to be recalibrated,&quot; the IMF's report said.Portugal's debt-to-GDP ratio is now expected to peak at 124% next year, two percentage points higher than at the IMF's last review earlier this year.That decision has been seen as part of a gradual shift away from doctrinaire austerity within the &quot;troika&quot; – the coalition of the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank that has overseen eurozone bailouts.But despite the more accommodating stance towards rescued governments, Portugal's deficit targets remain tough, and the IMF is concerned that the public could reject the austerity measures being demanded of their government.&quot;The hitherto sturdy social and political consensus that has buttressed strong programme implementation has weakened significantly,&quot; it warned.The IMF stressed that the outlook for Portugal's economy remains &quot;sombre&quot;. The economy contracted by 3.25% last year, and it is now expected to shrink again, by 2.25%, this year, partly driven by the slowdown across the rest of the euro area.&quot;Strong export growth, which has hitherto helped offset the contraction in domestic demand, has of late started to decrease reflecting weakening demand from the rest of the euro area&quot;.It added that unemployment, which is already at 18%, is likely to continue rising until at least 2014. Portugal will receive the next tranche of its bailout, worth ˆ657m, as a result of the IMF's review.Global economyJapanStock marketsAsia PacificEconomicsLarry Elliottguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="Downbeat forecasts help drive wave of selling in Japan amid fears that central bank stimulus measures might be withdrawnThe World Bank cut its forecasts for this year, citing a deeper than expected recession in Europe and a slowdown in China and India.Renewing fears about growth, it said the global economy was likely to grow by 2.2% this year, a downgrade from its January forecast of 2.4%.The downbeat forecasts helped to drive a wave of selling in Japan, where the Nikkei index tumbled 6.35% amid fears that central bank stimulus measures – led by the US – might be withdrawn. The World Bank also cut its forecast for growth in 2014 to 3.1% from 3%, but maintained its prediction that global GDP would increase by 3.3% in 2015.&quot;While there are markers of hope in the financial sector, the slowdown in the real economy is turning out to be unusually protracted,&quot; said Kaushik Basu, senior vice-president and chief economist at the bank.&quot;This is reflected in the stubbornly high unemployment in industrialised nations, with unemployment in the eurozone actually rising, and in the slowing growth in emerging economies.&quot;There were also heavy losses on European stock markets in morning trading. although the FTSE 100 recovered by mid-afternoon.Michael Hewson, senior market analyst at CMC Markets UK, a financial spread-betting company, said: &quot;European markets have plunged on the open in the wake of the 6.35% decline in the Nikkei overnight as investors continue to worry about the longevity of central bank stimulus measures, while another global growth downgrade from a global organisation, this time the World Bank, has prompted investors to question current stock market valuations.&quot;The bank is now predicting the eurozone economy will shrink by 0.6% this year, compared with an earlier forecast of a 0.1% decline in GDP. The currency bloc's economy is then expected to grow by 0.9% in 2014 and 1.5% in 2015.The World Bank highlighted slowing growth in China, as authorities there seek to rebalance the economy, and said India's annual growth had dropped below 6% for the first time in 10 years. It said there was concern that the US might begin to ease its support of the world's largest economy by withdrawing quantitative easing, or the use of central bank cash to buy up sovereign debt in the hope that financial institutions will reinvest the windfall in the wider economy.The bank added that austerity programmes, high unemployment, and weak consumer and business confidence would continue to impede growth in higher-income countries.It downgraded its forecasts for developing countries' GDP to 5.1% this year from an earlier forecast of 5.5%. Growth in 2014 and 2015 is expected to be 5.6% and 5.7% respectively.World BankEconomicsGlobal economyStock marketsChinaAsia PacificIndiaAngela Monaghanguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="Stephen Hester has been forced to leave the bank by George Osborne in his determination to accelerate privatisationAny doubt over who calls the shots at Britain's part-nationalised banks has been dispelled by the fate of Stephen Hester. The RBS chief executive has been forced out at the behest of George Osborne.Forget the arms-length paraphernalia of the UKFI holding company. When ministers want the bailed-out banks to do something, they do it.That's as it should be, since the state (not the &quot;taxpayer&quot; as the media constantly intones) currently owns 81% and 39% of RBS and Lloyds TSB respectively. The problem is what they want to do with them – which is sell them off fast, regardless of the loss to the public purse or the damage to the economy.The chancellor is driven by a mixture of unbending ideology and raw electoral calculation. He and David Cameron are determined to start the largest privatisations in Britain's history by the end of 2014 – just in time for a 2015 election.The idea is to engineer a &quot;Tell Sid&quot; 1980s-style Thatcherite handout to the right kind of voters, while ensuring that the heresy of publicly owned banks is consigned to the nightmares of the 2008 market meltdown.Hester, who now stands to pocket an extra ?5.6m after more than 40,000 RBS workers have lost their jobs, was insufficiently gung-ho for the scale of early sell-off Osborne regards as critical to Tory fortunes. His successor will get the message.Next week Osborne is expected to set out the kind of discounts he plans to offer for Lloyds shares. He's also toying with the rightwing thinktank Policy Exchange's plan for a wider share giveaway.For the Tory leadership, it's a trade-off between the appearance of a public windfall and the risk of being seen again to stuff the pockets of the better-off as living standards plummet. In reality, it will be a fraud against the public and an attack on genuine economic recovery.The Brown government paid well over the odds to prevent the collapse of RBS and Lloyds in 2008. Now, Cameron and Osborne show every sign of selling the public stakes well below them, as they did with Northern Rock. No amount of dodgy breakeven accounting will hide the billions that stand to be lost.But even more important, returning the banks to the private sector that brought them to the brink in the first place will throw away a decisive lever to rebuild and restructure the economy for the future.That's not the way the part-nationalised banks have been run for the past five years, of course. The overriding political concern has been to prepare them for re-privatisation. Even now, RBS and Lloyds lending to businesses is actually falling as a result.But that's a political decision – and, as we've seen this week, it's the politicians who are in charge. RBS and Lloyds could be used now as a motor of growth and investment to reshape the economy, channelling lending to infrastructure, the sectors of the future and public housebuilding.Private investment has as good as collapsed in Britain. But instead of using the publicly controlled banks to fill that gap, Osborne is in a frenzy to hand them back to the private sector, pumping up mortgage lending instead.There's a wider case for bank breakups, regional banks and mutuals to create a finance sector that supports sustainable growth. But right now, use the tools we've got. Support for turning RBS into a fully fledged public bank stretches from the TUC via Vince Cable to Margaret Thatcher's chancellor Nigel Lawson. The best hope must be that Osborne's pre-election scam fails.Stephen HesterPrivatisationRoyal Bank of ScotlandBankingEconomic policyEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsGeorge OsborneSeumas Milneguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="Investors wary of turmoil in Greece and Turkey, doubts about Abenomics, and uncertainty over the Fed's QE programmeWhen investors in the world's financial markets are in an anxious mood, such as in recent weeks, any new piece of information tends to be taken as a fresh reason to sell.Their overarching concern – and the markets' frame for almost everything else that happens – is that the US Federal Reserve may be considering &quot;tapering&quot; its massive quantitative easing programme, amid signs that the world's largest economy is starting to recover.It's unlikely that any change to the Fed's bond-buying plan is imminent; but the merest hint – dropped by chairman Ben Bernanke on 22 May – that the flood of cheap money that has supercharged markets could slow to a trickle has been enough to rock confidence.Against that background, investors were already in a mood to pull funds out of riskier emerging markets, which won't look such a great bet without cheap money to gamble with.Elsewhere the turmoil in Greece, with the abrupt shutdown of the state broadcaster prompting renewed alarm about the stability of the governing coalition, reopened familiar fears about the euro crisis.Meanwhile, the violent crackdown on protests in Turkey – formerly seen as a paragon of stability – has given added impetus to investors' desire to run a mile from what is politely called &quot;political risk&quot;.Another set of markets rocked in recent days has been those such as Australia, where the economy is heavily dependent on exports to China. There are increasing signs that China is slowing as its growth model changes, and there are also alarming reports about the fragile state of the financial sector. A sharp downturn in China would rock a whole range of economies that rode out the Great Recession on the back of rampant Chinese demand.The final factor alarming investors is that the gloss appears to be coming off Abenomics – the Japanese government's plan for radically rebooting the country's economy. Many commentators have been disappointed by the so-called &quot;third arrow&quot; of Abe's policies. In addition to fiscal stimulus and &quot;shock and awe&quot; quantitative easing, Abe was expected to use the breathing space created by QE to implement a range of structural reforms to kickstart stodgy businesses and rebuild the tax system.But so far there has been scant detail. At the same time, the yen has been rising sharply – exactly the opposite effect to the one the Japanese authorities had hoped for – choking off the recovery by smashing demand for Japan's exports.The markets' response to the initial announcement from the Bank of Japan that it planned to double the size of the country's monetary base was so drastic that even if the policy had been unqualified success, the Nikkei would probably have looked overvalued. But the niggling doubts about the policy's effectiveness are unlikely to be assuaged in the short term.It was clear for some months that markets had become overvalued, getting ahead of the pace of recovery in major economies, and disregarding the continuing risk of turmoil in the eurozone and across a range of emerging markets. It is still not clear whether the selloff in recent days marks the end of the bull run artificially engineered by the world's central banks. But investors everywhere are bracing themselves for a long, volatile summer.EconomicsEconomic policyJapanAsia PacificFederal ReserveUS economyGreeceEuropeTurkeyEurozone crisisFinancial crisisHeather Stewartguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="Every aspect of the G8 summit points to a profound malaise – don't expect the drivers of poverty and inequality to be troubledThe UK is hosting the G8 for the first time since 2005, when the global economy was still booming. And everything about it has a whiff of farce and enervation. Last month, for example, it was reported that &quot;fake&quot; shop fronts had been set up in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland, to prepare the place for the G8 summit.Those who wish to impose a reality check on the leaders gathered at the summit will have a tough time doing so. The event will be protected by a security fence, riot police, dog handlers, water cannon and perhaps even unmanned drones.Everywhere there is the spectacle of affluence (for the rich); everywhere there is stagnation (for the rest). In Britain, despite talk of a recovery, the fundamentals remain weak. Profits are high, and companies are sitting on mountains of cash. But pay is stagnating, and hardly anyone is investing in jobs. The International Labor Organisation says that the same can be found globally, with rising unemployment and poverty becoming structural.The striking fact is that this calamity has struck without making a serious dent in the neoliberal orthodoxy that dominates global decision-making.From Genoa to Gleneagles, the G8 has long attracted attention as a focal point of anticapitalist protesters, precisely because of the group's role in promoting neoliberal policies. Although it wasn't formally designed for the implementation of such policies, it lent a degree of cohesion to participating leaderships, gave important support to governments undertaking neoliberal reforms, and helped develop a shared global strategy for the major economic powers. It remains a significant power despite the crisis and the rise of the G20.So it is perhaps significant that Tuesday's G8 protests were largely symbolic and ineffectual, and the organisational network behind them was easily cracked by the police. The protests in Northern Ireland, involving the major trade unions, may be larger: but it seems hard to envisage another Gleneagles, let alone a Genoa.One suspects this is partly because the agenda has moved on. Previously international institutions were targeted because they were seen as the bearers of real power, as the nation state seemed to be weakening. In the era of austerity, it is precisely states that are the bearers of revamped neoliberalism.And while the symbiotic relationship between well-meaning NGOs and the world's most powerful governments seems hardly to have suffered a dent, it too is showing signs of exhaustion.During the last UK-hosted G8 summit, the NGOs and their celebrity spokespeople organised a major political and cultural campaign intended to pressure the G8 into a programme of poverty-reduction. It largely failed. The NGOs were too complicit with New Labour, and worked overtime to purge their events and publicity of politics. Their campaigns, focusing a great deal on Africa, notably contained very little input on the part of anyone from that continent. Ultimately, little was achieved.This year, although there is less focus on &quot;development&quot; issues – David Cameron's major objective in the G8 summit is to achieve a bountiful US-EU trade deal that he hopes will stimulate the British economy – there will be talk of tax transparency and food security. Once again, an ensemble of NGOs has sprung up, who want a repeat of Make Poverty History.The repeat is less tragic than farcical. Last Saturday saw crowds, much lower than for Live 8, turn out for a celebrity-led event featuring the billionaire Bill Gates. Their controversial demand: for the G8 countries to &quot;act now&quot; to &quot;end hunger&quot;. Pressed to their limits, they will say that the government should act to curb tax avoidance and use some of the recouped money to increase aid. One senses that if Gates can sign up to this, it is no serious threat to the rich.Cameron, like Tony Blair, has thrown the NGOs a bone: he will fight for an international mechanism to monitor where multinationals make their money, and where they pay their taxes. The NGOs are duly impressed, and cheer Cameron on. It should go without saying that they will be presented with some sort of &quot;breakthrough achievement&quot; to celebrate, and declare their efforts a success. Meanwhile the major dynamic forces of poverty and inequality will remain untouched until the G8 visits again.The spectacles surrounding this year's G8, attempting to emulate the routines of the boom years, are symptoms of a profound economic, political and cultural stagnation. Much has changed, and yet so much remains exactly the same.G8Global economyEconomicsGlobal recessionPovertySocial exclusionProtestRichard Seymourguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="It's the great new reality of British politics, and all the parties are in the same boat: fighting austerity elections for years to comeNo political party or established political culture is at ease with the kind of politics we are in at the moment. The Tory party hates coalition, and dreams of reigniting a Thatcherite revolution if it improbably triumphs in 2015. Labour, meanwhile, dreams of a social democratic Britain of the kind that eluded successive Labour governments. And the Liberal Democrats dream of doubling their number of MPs by 2030. Honestly, they do.The truth, though, is that these are all largely fantasies. The reality of British politics is at the interface between Liam Byrne's infamous &quot;there's no more money&quot; remark in 2010, and the general decline of the major political parties that has been so marked over half a century. In the immediate postwar period almost everyone voted Labour or Conservative. Now no more than two-thirds of voters do. The result is coalitions – either between parties or within them.The central fact about British politics in 2013 is that we are beginning to get it. The economy is not recovering, but surviving. Politics is taking time to adjust. At present it is like an F1 race permanently led by a safety car. The rebalancing of the economy is talked about and desired on all sides but isn't happening because, short of a command economy for which there is no serious appetite and which would almost certainly fail in its own way, it cannot be legislated. The financial sector still overshadows everything else. And the deficit is too large.So political parties find themselves, against their will and instincts, all in the same boat. The Tories still hate higher taxes. Labour still hates cutting government programmes. The arguments between the parties are still real. But they are constrained by the single great fact of austerity. And austerity is not going to go away.The public mood is not really for radical change, although there is a flirtation from time to time. Make the bankers pay. Leave the EU. Invest in this. Cut that. Punish immigrants. Encourage more skilled migrants. But the public reality was attested by this week's Institute for Fiscal Studies report on the decline of real wages – the longest and deepest loss of output in a century, with productivity levels dropping sharply and real wages falling by more – 6% – than in any comparable five-year period.It was underscored too in Wednesday's unemployment figures. The bulk of jobs growth is in part-time work and self-employment, not traditional full-time jobs. And pay is failing to keep abreast of inflation, as it has done without interruption for over three years.All this supports the picture of people staying in work and accepting lower pay or shorter hours rather than allowing themselves to fall into unemployment. If you could sum up the public mood in a sentence, it might be: &quot;Things are getting worse but I'd rather hang on in there somehow, even at a cost.&quot; That's a new mood, not heroic except in its will to survive – and political parties, with their comfortable visions and urge to do something memorable, are struggling to adapt to it.The economic and the political implications of this collective battening down of the hatches are daunting. It leaves all political parties constrained. Some condemn them for this, sometimes from within the parties themselves, more often from the sidelines or from protest parties. But the parties may deserve more support for their realism than they are receiving. The first thing one wants from any government is to understand the situation it faces.Naturally, there are options about what to do. The Conservatives could be much more Thatcherite if they weren't so aware of how unpopular that would be. Labour always has the Keynesian option of taxing and spending to boost the economy. But that won't do much to address the deficit, and there is no sign at all of a widespread public appetite for it.The truth is that politics has changed and that the change will last a long time. A week ago the IFS argued, in yet another report, that the failure to balance the budget deficit by 2014-15, as planned in 2010, means that the next parliament may be just as dominated by spending controls and efficiency savings as this one has been. Most of the deficit, after all, is structural, so can't be reduced by growth alone. Difficult decisions about programmes and entitlements are not going to disappear even if sustained growth returns.Party leaders understand this. David Cameron clearly does. This month's spending review will offer more – a lot more – of the same, and the prospect of large further cuts still to come during the next parliament. It's not where he would like to be, but where he is. But last week's speeches by Ed Miliband and Ed Balls show they get it too in their own way. If there is a Labour government after 2015, it will not only cap the welfare budget – the details are a source of dispute – but will cut departmental spending still further.This is not a great ideological battle. That dimension is often exaggerated. The difference between a public spending-to-GDP ratio of 40% and one of 50% is a significant one. But beware the narcissism of small differences. The big truth is that any government will spend 40%, not that there is an argument about another 10% between the parties. That said, it is high time the left had a debate about the figure that it prefers. There is certainly a limit below which a decent level of solidarity is not possible. But it is not self-evident that higher is invariably better or sustainable.Is it pretty? No. Are there alternatives? Certainly. But they have to be consistent with looking reality in the eye. Since many of the problems are shared with other parts of Europe, it makes sense to address them together, not in competition. But looking in the other direction is not a serious option. The figures and the graphs tell stories of opportunity and contain truths that cannot be ignored. Not only will the 2015 election now be an austerity election, but the 2020 election may be one as well. Better get used to it.AusterityEconomicsConservativesLabourLiberal DemocratsMartin Kettleguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="For first time there are now more than 1 million workers in UK aged over 65The number of workers in Britain aged over 65 has risen above 1 million for the first time as firms increasingly prefer older employees to younger staff.Latest jobless figures from the Office for National Statistics highlighted the &quot;greying&quot; of the workplace amid signs that growth in early 2013 is starting to have an effect on jobs.Data released on Wednesday shows that unemployment fell by 5,000 to 2.51 million in the three months ending in April.Employment rose by 24,000 during the quarter, beating the City's expectations of a small fall in the number of people in work. The ONS said there were now 29.76 million people in employment, up 432,000 on a year ago.Of these, 1,030,000 were over 65, up by 38,000 on the quarter and by 96,000 on the February-to-April period of 2012.Younger people had a tougher time breaking into the jobs market. The number of 16-24-year-olds in employment fell by 4,000 to 3.68 million in the three months to April.Jim Hillage, director of research at the Institute for Employment Studies, said the rise in employment for the over-65s was significant. &quot;While this reflects a welcome willingness among employers to recruit and retain experienced people, it may also reflect the need that some older people have to top up inadequate pension arrangements.&quot;Jobs continue to be shed from the public sector, with employment down by 22,000 in the latest period for which figures are available, the three months to March 2013. But an expanding private sector created 46,000 additional jobs in the same period.The ONS said the UK's jobless rate remained unchanged between the latest quarters at 7.8%, but that it was down 0.4 points on the previous year. The government's alternative measure of unemployment – the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance – fell by 8,600 to 1.51million in May, the ONS said.Higher bonus payments led to an increase in the rate of growth of average earnings. Although still running below the current 2.7% inflation rate, earnings were 1.3% higher between February and April than a year earlier. That compared with a 0.6% increase in the three months endingin March.The official data came in the wake of a report from the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing a 6% drop in real wages since the start of the recession – the biggest five-year drop since modern records began.The jobs figures added to City speculation that the economy will grow by around 0.5-0.6% in the second quarter of 2013, following 0.3% expansion in the first three months of the year.Mark Hoban, employment minister, said: &quot;It's a credit to the growth of British businesses up and down the country that we now have a record number of people employed in the private sector.&quot;With the number of people in work increasing, and unemployment down, these are welcome figures. The fact that youth unemployment is also down is a positive sign. But we are not complacent. Through schemes like the Work Programme and the Youth Contract we will continue to help people find the jobs they need so they can realise their aspiration of looking after themselves and their families and help the country compete in the global race.&quot;Ian Brinkley, director of the Work Foundation, said: &quot;The labour market figures released this morning give a mixed picture. Overall, employment is still holding up, especially in the private sector. But long term unemployment is still rising. Nearly 900,000 people have been out of work for more than a year, and nearly 460,000 out of work for more than two years.&quot;The coalition needs to set out clearly in this month's spending review how it intends to reverse this trend, which is damaging the job prospects of individuals and our long-term economic success.&quot; Unemployment and employment statisticsOlder peopleUnemploymentEconomicsLarry Elliottguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="Small firms are lightening pay packets more than big companies, which are instead chucking P45s around like confettiIt has become a ritual. The employment numbers come out and ministers seize on a couple of stats that are moving the right way, while the unions hunt out other numbers that are instead heading south. Yesterday we learnt that unemployment had fallen by 5,000 – a statistical cigarette paper – at the same time as the employment rate had inched down by a similarly marginal 0.1 percentage points. The experts can always come up with yawnsome explanations as to why different figures pull in different directions, but all the lay person needs to take away is that all this adds up to a job market that is more becalmed than anything else. The unemployment rate bumped up from just above 5% to around 8% during the first few months of the crash, and it has done little more than bob around that level over the four years since, to reach 7.8% yesterday.No news, however, is tremendously good news in one important sense. The great recession, we're all weary of reading, is the biggest slump in living memory – output has fallen much further than at any point since the second world war, and the recovery is more anaemic than in the 1930s. Few foresaw this scale of collapse, but any mainstream economist who did would have predicted unemployment of more like 4 million than 3 million. It is in that context that the community as a whole can count unemployment of &quot;only&quot; 2.5 million as a blessing, even if it is scarce comfort to the 2.5 million individuals directly affectedThe opposition rightly points to the important caveat of underemployment, workers stuck with involuntarily reduced hours, but the ranks of the unwilling part-timers were yesterday revealed to be thinning somewhat, and the total number of hours being worked across the economy is now back to what it was before Lehman Brothers fell over. While it is true migrant labour is working an appreciable chunk of these hours, it is a remarkable fact that just as much toil as ever before is being done in an economy that is – still – churning out substantially less than before.Describe Britain's position that way, and it suddenly appears less tremendously good than tremendously worrying news. Yes, it is a relief not to be plunging back to the black stuff in 1980s fashion, but working just as hard to produce less than before does not sound attractive – it sounds like centuries of technical progress spinning into reverse. Computers are not really suddenly getting slower nor are industrial processes suddenly being forgotten, but given what has been happening to wages workers could be forgiven for imagining such reverse innovation. Strip out bonuses (distorted this April by shenanigans invited by George Osborne's top tax cut) and typical pay is inching up by 0.9%; officially favoured measures of the cost of living keep changing, but the traditional retail price index is climbing at 2.9%, implying that the average worker is getting poorer by about 2% every year. This incremental impoverishment is starting to add up. The Institute for Fiscal Studies yesterday confirmed that the five-year fall in real wages already witnessed is a squeeze on a scale that has never been seen before – and it's not finished yet.By hunting out where pay is being cut most severely, the IFS also shed interesting light on what is driving wages down. Small firms are lightening pay packets far more than big companies, which have instead retrenched through the time-honoured British means of chucking P45s around like confetti. Learning that independent shops and restaurants are cutting wages exposes the absurdity of the Tory right's claims that Britain's real problem is budding entrepreneurs being strangled by red tape that makes hiring too costly. There are also signs that workers are paying a price for the new competition from the likes of lone parents, whom aggressive workfare policies are chivvying to take up whatever work might be available, irrespective of the wage. Such interactions are only beginning to be analysed; but as they are understood, interest will go far and wide. Wage rage is not the preserve of a hapless few, it is the fury of the many.PayWork  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

      <text text="The sudden decision to close the Greek state television and radio company ERT and dismiss up to 3,000 journalists and technicians is the culmination of a series of attacks on free speech. This symbolic move, as the government put it in a non-paper, means that private interests have used the financial crisis as a pretext to destroy the main source of non-partisan information and cultural programming in Greece.

Well, good luck with that. The EU's Eurostat agency reports average youth unemployment at a staggering 23.5% across the 27 EU member states (24% in the 17-member eurozone). All the signs, so familiar to British trade unionists since the 1980s, of a neoliberal economic experiment destroying good-quality jobs and slashing the social wage in a compulsive hunt for global competitiveness, are there. Far from turning their back on austerity policies, the leaders of the EU last week announced a modest extension of the timescale in which France's Socialist government must cut public spending, coupled with a requirement for a wholesale scrapping of French legislation that protects workers from hire-and-fire policies.The answer to chronic unemployment will not be found in the EU, which binds its members into low-wage and deflationary policies through successive treaties from Maastricht to Lisbon that British governments have signed up to without a referendum. Neither does a EU-US free trade agreement offer a break with these policies, but opens Europe's public services up to US corporations seeking profits from taxpayer funding.

      <text text="Our brand of capitalism has become cannibalistic. The minimum wage isn't enough, and has become a profound drag on our economy'It is important to grasp the deep cause of the present crisis,&quot; wrote the American economist David Schweickart in 2009. &quot;It is not the sub-prime lending nor the housing bubble that might have been reined in.&quot; Brilliant. I hate it when people blame sub-prime. Half the room thinks &quot;this is a poor person's problem&quot;, the other half thinks &quot;this is an American problem&quot;, and I personally start thinking about prime rib. &quot;It is not Wall Street greed, nor their feckless 'innovations', nor even the reckless borrowing that has characterised almost all sectors of the economy,&quot; he goes on. &quot;These factors have all played a role, but they are at best proximate causes.&quot; But if poor people aren't stupid and rich people aren't greedy, I don't really see where this sports match is going.In fact it's going towards one of those graphs that Twitter calls &quot;the most mind-blowing graph you'll ever see&quot; – it won't blow your mind, but that's a good thing. You will need your mind. It simply shows the divergence of productivity and wages in the US between 1945 and the present day. During capitalism's &quot;golden age&quot;, 1945-75, the (simplified) story is that wages and gross domestic product went in tandem. From 1975 onwards, wages flatlined and productivity continued to grow. In the UK, where neoliberalism moved more slowly and had, at least to start with, more effective foes, productivity didn't peel away from wages until 2003.From here, the crisis proceeded as inexorably as the final tricks in a hand of whist. Wages no longer met consumption but the people at the bottom still had to consume, and those producing still needed them to do so. Lines of credit were extended, whether in the form of a sub-prime mortgage or a 0% credit card, and consumption continued.This makes it a fairly pointless task, making a choice of culprit between the employers who drove down wages, the casino banks who took unintelligent risks, or the high street banks who extended credit with no thought for those they were lending to – all concentrating only on how to keep their own ship steady. They form a nexus in which they are all as important as each other.The economist Ann Pettifor describes it as &quot;cannibalistic capitalism&quot;. They consume their own customers. Then they wonder why their sales are so low. Then they use the severity of the recession as a rationale for treating people more harshly, and wonder why their sales are even lower. Never mind &quot;unsustainable&quot;, this actively propels us into an ever-worsening situation.The solutions to this will be large and manifold – they'll start with collective pay-bargaining, and an generalised acceptance that unions are not about angry men in smelly jackets but the mechanisms by which people who work exert any power over those who profit from their work. But before that can happen, or anything that this situation needs, a fundamental acknowledgment has to be made.Wages in Britain are too low. Weknow they'd dropped away from GDP before the recession, but the situation has since become much starker. The Institute for Fiscal Studies produced research today revealing average pay cuts of 6% over five years. Given that workers would normally see 2% annual rises, this amounts to a gap of 15% between what they're earning now and what they would have earned without the slump.Two related political slogans have been tailored for the purpose of denying this: the first is &quot;reform benefits to make work pay&quot;; the second is the false dichotomy between strivers and skivers.You don't reform benefits to make work pay. You reform wages. The minimum wage is not enough to live on, even leaving aside the rate of unemployment, the rate of under-employment – people who would like to work more hours butfor some reason probably related to withholding their statutory rights are on zero- or four-hour contracts – and all those cannibalistic stunts that particularly large large employers,, in particular, have adopted. This is a profound drag on an economy trying to get out of recession. Reducingbenefits won't help.The strivers versus skivers narrative is, overall, devised to build a scapegoat class for a situation that would otherwise seem senseless: how is it reasonable to work full-time and not be able to pay your rent? How is it fair that all the flexibility in the workplace must be borne by the employee and none by the employer, so that a supermarket worker might start each week not knowing how much money they'll take home?How can a government lecture you on parenting on the one hand, and idleness on the other, from within a system where paying for childcare leaves many people's work income-neutral, and keeping your head above water will probably involve at least one parent not seeing their children at all? These are questions that are short-circuited by the spectre of a leech class, imbalancing the economy by actively refusing work in favour of benefits. But the sheer, grinding difficulty of life on a low wage cannot have escaped the notice of the people living it.There has been a problem looming over the debate since the financial crisis exploded. The culprits are too large and too complicated, the solutions are too revolutionary and too violent – and above all, how do you gather opinion behind a set of ideas that are too intricate to explain? But this idea is simple: wages that people can't live on will drag a society into recession and hold it there, whether the state subsidises those wages or not.Twitter: @zoesqwilliamsPayBenefitsRecessionEconomic growth (GDP)EconomicsEconomic policyFamily financesMinimum wageZoe Williamsguardian.co.uk  2013 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
